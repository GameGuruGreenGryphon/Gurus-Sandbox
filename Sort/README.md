# Sort

C project for myself, for learning how to manipulate integer arrays.

Implements Bogosort and Quick Sort.

## For Those Uninitiated

Inside `sort.c` contains many comments explaining what each portion of code does.

If this was code for industry-standard programs, this program would be considered to have too many comments.

This is not for industry-standard programs, however. It is for learning.
