Note to self: DON'T have another executable on your system with the same name as the script you use to compile your programs.
Next time, use "which" to find what exactly is being ran.

The bash script currently named "build" used to be named "comp".
In my PATH, I had a previous script named "comp" that was being ran instead of the one in this github repo.
This gave me a massive headache.
Be careful what you put in your PATH variable, kids.
